# MakeCode extension for the solder:bit Gamepad

The solder:bit Gamepad originated as a workshop idea for the [Device prototyping and production summer school](https://prosquared.org/event/2024-summer-school/) held at Lancaster University. Designed primarily to introduce participants to the fundamentals of surface mount (SMT) soldering, this project not only demystifies a key skill in electronics but also integrates the fun and educational platform of the BBC micro:bit. Read more about the solder:bit Gamepad on this [repository](https://github.com/devices-lab/solderbit-gamepad).
